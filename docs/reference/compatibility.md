# Compatibility

- Home Assistant 2026.7.0 or newer
- Node.js 24 for development and CI
- Current Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari releases
- LG ThinQ refrigerators exposing compatible standard entities

Dependency compatibility is maintained through npm overrides. The development toolchain
pins `qs` to `6.15.3`; this internal maintenance update requires no Home Assistant
configuration changes.

Breaking compatibility changes require an explicit major release or migration note.
